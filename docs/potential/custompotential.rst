*********************************
Defining your own potential class
*********************************

Introduction
============

There are two ways to define a new potential class: with pure-Python, or with
Cython. The advantage to writing a new class in Cython is that the
computations can execute with C-like speeds, however only certain integrators
support using this functionality anyways. If you are not familiar with Cython,
you probably want to stick to a pure-Python class.
