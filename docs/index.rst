Stream Team Package Documentation
#################################

Welcome to the `stream-team` documentation!

This package contains functionality common to various collaborative
astrophysics projects between Columbia, Yale, and NYU. For example,
reading n-body simulations used by the group, coordinate transformations,
numerical integration. The package is being actively developed in
`a public repository on GitHub <https://github.com/stream-team/stream-team>`_
so if you have any trouble,
`open an issue <https://github.com/stream-team/stream-team/issues>`_ there.
