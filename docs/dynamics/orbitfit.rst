Introduction
============

Stellar streams form from disrupting stellar systems (e.g., dwarf galaxies, globular clusters)
as they orbit within a host galaxy. To first order, the stars that are stripped from the
progenitor systems follow orbits that have a small dispersion around the orbit of the
progenitor itself. Though fitting a single orbit to observed stellar stream stars can lead
to biases in inferences about the underlying gravitational potential, it is often useful to
do this in order to generate initial guesses for more sophisticated modeling efforts. This
module contains functions to assist with this.
