class CartesianOrbit(object):
    """
    Represents an orbit in Cartesian coordinates -- positions
    and velocities (conjugate momenta) at different times.

    The position and velocity quantities (arrays) can have an arbitrary
    number of dimensions, but axis 0 and 1 have special meaning:

        - `axis=0` is the coordinate dimension (e.g., x, y, z)
        - `axis=1` is the time dimension

    So if the input position array, `pos`, has shape `pos.shape = (3, 100)`, this
    would be a 3D orbit (`pos[0]` is `x`, `pos[1]` is `y`, etc.). For representing
    multiple orbits, the position array could have 3 axes, e.g., it might have shape
    `pos.shape = (3, 100, 8)`, where this is interpreted as a 3D position at 100 times
    for 8 different orbits. The same is true for velocity. The position and velocity
    arrays must have the same shape.

    If a time argument is specified, the position and velocity arrays must have
    the same number of timesteps as the length of the time object::

        len(t) == pos.shape[1]

    Parameters
    ----------
    pos : array_like, :class:`~astropy.units.Quantity`
        Positions. If a numpy array (e.g., has no units), this will be
        stored as a dimensionless :class:`~astropy.units.Quantity`. See
        the note above about the assumed meaning of the axes of this object.
    vel : array_like, :class:`~astropy.units.Quantity`
        Velocities. If a numpy array (e.g., has no units), this will be
        stored as a dimensionless :class:`~astropy.units.Quantity`. See
        the note above about the assumed meaning of the axes of this object.
    t : array_like, :class:`~astropy.units.Quantity` (optional)
        Array of times. If a numpy array (e.g., has no units), this will be
        stored as a dimensionless :class:`~astropy.units.Quantity`.
    potential : `~gary.potential.PotentialBase` (optional)
        The potential that the orbit was integrated in.
